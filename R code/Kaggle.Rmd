Convert the string representation of image into integers. 

strsplit splits the string, unlist simplifies its output to a vector of strings and as.integer converts it to a vector of integers.
```{r}
img <- sm.train$Image
as.integer(unlist(strsplit(img[1], " ")))
```


Choose only the first 30 columns in the dataset.
```{r}
sm.train1 <- sm.train[,1:30]
```
